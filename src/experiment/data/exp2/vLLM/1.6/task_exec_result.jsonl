Let’s determine their names:\n- The first note is on the **second line from the bottom** (D).\n- The second note is on the **bottom space** (E).\n- The third note is on the **third line from the bottom** (G).\n- The fourth note is on the **first line from the bottom** (B).\n- The fifth note is on the **top space** (C).\n\nSo, the sequence of notes is: D, E, G, B, C.\n\n### Step 2: Interpret the Word Spelled Out by the Note Letters\nThe notes spell out the word \"DEGBC\". This does not form an immediately recognizable English word. However, if we rearrange these letters, we can try to find a meaningful word. Rearranging them gives us \"BEGC\", which still doesn't make sense. After further rearrangement, we notice that the letters can spell out \"EDGE\" when rearranged.\n\nThus, the word spelled out by the notes is **EDGE**.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Meaning of \"Edge\"\nIn the context of age, \"edge\" typically refers to being close to reaching a specific milestone. For example, someone who is \"on the edge\" of turning 18 would mean they are about to turn 18 but haven't yet reached that exact moment.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Age Based on the Clue\nSince the word \"EDGE\" implies being just before a significant age, we need to interpret this as someone who is about to reach a certain age but hasn't quite gotten there yet. A common interpretation of \"edge\" in terms of age milestones could be someone who is just shy of 18 years old, as this is a notable threshold (e.g., legal adulthood in many places).\n\nThus, the person described is **17 years old**, as they are on the \"edge\" of turning 18.\n\n### Final Answer:\nFINAL ANSWER: 17", "start_time": 1754746000.6688957, "end_time": 1754746000.6688957}, "status": "finished"}

Please provide your response in algebraic notation.", "final_answer": "To determine the best move for Black that guarantees a win, let's analyze the position step by step:\n\n1. **Current Position Analysis**:\n   - White has a king on h2, pawns on g3 and f4, and pieces on e5, d6, and c7.\n   - Black has a king on b8, pawns on a6, b7, c6, d7, e6, and f7, and pieces on d4 and g6.\n\n2. **Key Observations**:\n   - White's king is trapped on the edge of the board and cannot escape easily due to Black's pawn structure.\n   - Black has a strong passed pawn on d7, which can be pushed forward to promote into a queen.\n   - The white bishop on c7 is pinned against the white king and cannot effectively defend against Black's threats.\n\n3. **Black's Plan**:\n   - Black should focus on advancing the d-pawn to d8 and promoting it into a queen, as this will guarantee a decisive material advantage and ultimately checkmate White.\n\n4. **Next Move**:\n   - The most direct way to achieve this is to move the d-pawn forward. However, before doing so, Black needs to ensure that the d-pawn is not blocked or captured.\n   - Currently, the white bishop on c7 controls the square d8, preventing the immediate promotion of the d-pawn. To address this, Black can push the d-pawn one rank closer to the promotion square while maintaining control over key squares.\n\n5. **Best Move**:\n   - Moving the d-pawn from d7 to d6 (`d6`) is the logical choice. This move advances the d-pawn closer to promotion and puts pressure on White to react. If White captures the d-pawn with the bishop (`Bxd6`), Black can recapture with the knight on d4 (`Nxd6+`), gaining an extra piece and securing a winning position.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe best move for Black is `d6`.\n\nFINAL ANSWER: d6", "start_time": 1754746165.062195, "end_time": 1754746165.0621953}, "status": "finished"}

Let's identify each note based on its position:\n- The first note is on the **third line from the bottom** (G).\n- The second note is on the **second space from the bottom** (B).\n- The third note is on the **first space from the bottom** (D).\n- The fourth note is on the **fourth line from the bottom** (F).\n- The fifth note is on the **second line from the bottom** (A).\n\nSo, the sequence of notes is: **G, B, D, F, A**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Form the word using the note letters\nThe note letters spell out the word: **GBDFA**.\n\nThis can be rearranged to form the word: **FADGB**, which spells \"FADGB\". However, we need to interpret this in context. Since the question asks about an \"age,\" we should look for a meaningful interpretation. The most logical interpretation here is that these notes correspond to the word \"FADGB\" rearranging to \"BADGF\", but more likely, it could represent something else like \"FADGB\" forming a phrase or hinting at something else. Given typical puzzles, let’s consider if there’s a common term or concept related to ages that might fit.\n\nUpon closer inspection, the notes do not directly spell any standard English word related to age. Instead, they may be intended to point us toward another method of solving the puzzle.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Count the total number of lines and notes\nIn the provided sheet music:\n- There are **5 notes**.\n- The staff has **5 lines** in total (as per the bass clef).\n\nThus, the total number of lines and notes is:\n$$\n5 \\text{ (lines)} + 5 \\text{ (notes)} = 10.\n$$\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Count the number of notes on lines\nFrom the identified positions:\n- The first note is on the third line.\n- The second note is on the second space.\n- The third note is on the first space.\n- The fourth note is on the fourth line.\n- The fifth note is on the second line.\n\nNotes on lines: G (third line), F (fourth line), A (second line).  \nTotal notes on lines: **3**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Calculate the result\nThe problem states to find the age by calculating:\n$$\n\\text{Total number of lines and notes} - \\text{Number of notes on lines}.\n$$\n\nSubstitute the values:\n$$\n10 - 3 = 7.\n$$\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\nFINAL ANSWER: 7", "start_time": 1754746191.21022, "end_time": 1754746191.2102203}, "status": "finished"}

In the image, it's currently red's turn. If the red player's move captures as many blue pieces as possible, how many blue pieces will be in a position to capture at least one red piece on blue's next turn?", "final_answer": "To solve this problem, let's analyze the current state of the checkerboard and determine the optimal move for the red player that maximizes the number of captured blue pieces. Then, we'll evaluate how many blue pieces can capture at least one red piece after the move.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Board\n- **Red Pieces**: There are 9 red pieces on the board, including two kings (highlighted).\n- **Blue Pieces**: There are 8 blue pieces on the board.\n\nThe red player must make a move that captures as many blue pieces as possible. We need to identify all possible capturing moves for red and choose the one that results in the maximum number of captures.\n\n### Step 2: Identify Possible Capturing Moves for Red\nA capturing move in checkers involves jumping over an opponent's piece diagonally onto an empty square. Let's examine the potential jumps:\n\n#### Red Piece at B8:\n- Can jump over C6 to land on E4 (captures 1 blue piece).\n\n#### Red Piece at D8:\n- Can jump over F6 to land on H4 (captures 1 blue piece).\n\n#### Red Piece at A3:\n- Can jump over B5 to land on D7 (captures 1 blue piece).\n\n#### Red Piece at C3:\n- Can jump over D5 to land on F7 (captures 1 blue piece).\n\n#### Red Piece at E3:\n- Can jump over F5 to land on H7 (captures 1 blue piece).\n\n#### Red Piece at G7:\n- Can jump over F5 to land on D3 (captures 1 blue piece).\n\n#### Red Piece at H1:\n- Can jump over G3 to land on E5 (captures 1 blue piece).\n\nFrom the above analysis, each red piece has exactly one capturing move available. However, not all these moves can be executed simultaneously because some jumps may interfere with others.\n\n### Step 3: Choose the Optimal Move\nTo maximize the number of captured blue pieces, we need to chain jumps if possible. Let's focus on the most promising chains:\n\n#### Chain Starting from H1:\n- **H1 → E5** (captures G3)\n- From E5, further jumps are not possible.\n\nThis chain captures 1 blue piece.\n\n#### Chain Starting from G7:\n- **G7 → D3** (captures F5)\n- From D3, no further jumps are possible.\n\nThis chain captures 1 blue piece.\n\n#### Chain Starting from E3:\n- **E3 → H6** (captures F5)\n- From H6, no further jumps are possible.\n\nThis chain captures 1 blue piece.\n\n#### Chain Starting from C3:\n- **C3 → F6** (captures D5)\n- From F6, no further jumps are possible.\n\nThis chain captures 1 blue piece.\n\n#### Chain Starting from A3:\n- **A3 → D6** (captures B5)\n- From D6, no further jumps are possible.\n\nThis chain captures 1 blue piece.\n\n#### Chain Starting from B8:\n- **B8 → D6** (captures C6)\n- From D6, no further jumps are possible.\n\nThis chain captures 1 blue piece.\n\n#### Chain Starting from D8:\n- **D8 → F6** (captures E7)\n- From F6, no further jumps are possible.\n\nThis chain captures 1 blue piece.\n\n### Step 4: Execute the Optimal Move\nThe optimal move is to execute the longest chain of captures. However, since none of the chains overlap, we can only execute one chain per turn. The best choice is to select any single chain that captures one blue piece. For simplicity, let's assume the red player chooses the move **D8 → F6**, capturing the blue piece at E7.\n\nAfter this move, the board will look like this:\n- Red piece at D8 is removed.\n- Blue piece at E7 is removed.\n- A new red piece appears at F6.\n\n### Step 5: Evaluate Blue's Capture Opportunities\nAfter the move, we need to count how many blue pieces can capture at least one red piece. Let's check each blue piece:\n\n- **A1**: Cannot capture any red piece.\n- **B2**: Can capture the red piece at A3.\n- **C5**: Cannot capture any red piece.\n- **F4**: Can capture the red piece at E3.\n- **G5**: Can capture the red piece at H6 (if it existed, but it doesn't).\n- **H4**: Cannot capture any red piece.\n- **H6**: Does not exist anymore.\n- **H8**: Cannot capture any red piece.\n\nThus, the blue pieces that can capture at least one red piece are:\n- B2\n- F4\n\nThere are 2 blue pieces that can capture at least one red piece.\n\n### Final Answer\nFINAL ANSWER: 2", "start_time": 1754746441.358911, "end_time": 1754746441.358911}, "status": "finished"}

In the image, it's currently red's turn. If the red player's move captures as many blue pieces as possible, how many blue pieces will be in a position to capture at least one red piece on blue's next turn?", "final_answer": "To solve this problem, let's analyze the current state of the checkerboard and determine the optimal move for the red player that captures as many blue pieces as possible. Then, we'll assess how many blue pieces will be in a position to capture at least one red piece on their next turn.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Board\n- **Red Pieces**: There are multiple red pieces, including two kings (highlighted) located at B8 and D8.\n- **Blue Pieces**: Several blue pieces are scattered across the board, particularly in the upper right area.\n\nThe goal is to identify which red piece can make a capturing move that eliminates the most blue pieces. Capturing moves involve jumping over an opponent's piece diagonally and landing on an empty square beyond it. Kings can move and jump backward as well as forward.\n\n### Step 2: Identify Potential Captures by Red\nFrom the highlighted red pieces:\n- The red king at **B8** can potentially capture blue pieces.\n- The red king at **D8** can also potentially capture blue pieces.\n\n#### Red King at B8:\n- From B8, the red king can jump over blue pieces at C6 and E4, eliminating them if possible.\n- However, there are no direct paths from B8 that allow capturing multiple blue pieces in a single move.\n\n#### Red King at D8:\n- From D8, the red king can jump over blue pieces at F6 and H4, eliminating them if possible.\n- Specifically, the red king at D8 can perform a multi-capture sequence:\n  - Jump over the blue piece at F6 to land on H4 (capturing both F6 and H4).\n\nThis is the optimal move because it captures the maximum number of blue pieces (2) in a single turn.\n\n### Step 3: Update the Board After the Capture\nAfter the red king at D8 jumps over F6 and H4:\n- The red king lands on H4.\n- Blue pieces at F6 and H4 are removed.\n\nThe updated board after this move will have:\n- One fewer red piece (the red king has moved).\n- Two fewer blue pieces (F6 and H4 are captured).\n\n### Step 4: Assess Blue's Position to Capture Red Pieces\nNow, we need to check how many blue pieces remain and whether they can capture any red pieces on their next turn.\n\n#### Remaining Blue Pieces:\n- A7\n- C5\n- E5\n- G5\n\n#### Check for Capture Opportunities:\n- **A7**: Can jump over the red piece at B5 to capture it and land on D3.\n- **C5**: Cannot directly capture any red pieces.\n- **E5**: Cannot directly capture any red pieces.\n- **G5**: Can jump over the red piece at F3 to capture it and land on H1.\n\nThus, the blue pieces at **A7** and **G5** are in positions to capture red pieces on their next turn.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe number of blue pieces that can capture at least one red piece on their next turn is **2**.\n\nFINAL ANSWER: 2", "start_time": 1754746540.4251406, "end_time": 1754746540.425141}, "status": "finished"}

This means after the hop, we only need to count the remaining steps minus those skipped.\n\n   - Total steps = 20\n   - Steps skipped due to the hop = 3\n   - Remaining steps after the hop = \\( 20 - 3 = 17 \\)\n\n3. **Determine the stepping pattern**: You take two steps at a time.

Let's examine each red piece:\n\n- **Red piece at B8**: It cannot capture any blue pieces because there are no blue pieces directly adjacent to it.\n- **Red piece at D8**: It can capture the blue piece at E6 by moving to G4.\n- **Red piece at A3**: It cannot capture any blue pieces.\n- **Red piece at C3**: It cannot capture any blue pieces.\n- **Red piece at E3**: It can capture the blue piece at F5 by moving to H7.\n- **Red piece at G3**: It cannot capture any blue pieces.\n- **Red piece at A1**: It cannot capture any blue pieces.\n- **Red piece at G1**: It cannot capture any blue pieces.\n\nThe only capturing moves available for red are:\n1. Move from D8 to G4, capturing the blue piece at E6.\n2. Move from E3 to H7, capturing the blue piece at F5.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Outcome After Capturing Moves\nAfter making these capturing moves, the board will change as follows:\n- The red piece at D8 moves to G4, capturing the blue piece at E6.\n- The red piece at E3 moves to H7, capturing the blue piece at F5.\n\nThe updated positions after these moves are:\n- Red pieces at: B8, G4, A3, C3, H7, G3, A1, G1.\n- Blue pieces at: A7, C5, D5, F4, G4, H6.\n\n### Step 3: Identify Blue Pieces That Can Capture Red Pieces\nNow, we need to determine which blue pieces can capture any red pieces on their next turn. A blue piece can capture a red piece if it can jump over it to land on an empty square beyond it.\n\n#### Check Each Blue Piece:\n1. **Blue piece at A7**:\n   - Cannot capture any red pieces.\n   \n2. **Blue piece at C5**:\n   - Cannot capture any red pieces.\n   \n3. **Blue piece at D5**:\n   - Cannot capture any red pieces.\n   \n4. **Blue piece at F4**:\n   - Can capture the red piece at G3 by moving to H2.\n   \n5. **Blue piece at G4**:\n   - Can capture the red piece at H7 by moving to F2.\n   \n6. **Blue piece at H6**:\n   - Cannot capture any red pieces.\n\n### Step 4: Count the Number of Blue Pieces That Can Capture\nFrom the analysis above, the blue pieces that can capture red pieces are:\n- Blue piece at F4.\n- Blue piece at G4.\n\nThus, there are 2 blue pieces that can capture at least one red piece on blue's next turn.\n\n### Final Answer:\nFINAL ANSWER: 2", "start_time": 1754746589.108278, "end_time": 1754746589.108278}, "status": "finished"}

Answer with the following format: x.xx", "final_answer": "To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:\n\n### Step 1: Understand the current situation\n- You currently have the **Standard plan**, which provides **2 TB** of storage.\n- You are already **100 GB over the limit**, meaning you've used:\n  \\[\n  2\\, \\text{TB} + 100\\, \\text{GB} = 2,100\\, \\text{GB}\n  \\]\n- You need to upload an additional **980 files**, each of the same size as the files you've already uploaded.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the size of one file\nSince you've uploaded 60 files and are 100 GB over the limit, we can calculate the total size of these 60 files:\n\\[\n\\text{Total size of 60 files} = 100\\, \\text{GB}\n\\]\nThus, the size of one file is:\n\\[\n\\text{Size of one file} = \\frac{100\\, \\text{GB}}{60} = \\frac{5}{3}\\, \\text{GB} \\approx 1.67\\, \\text{GB}\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the total size needed for the remaining 980 files\nThe size required for the next 980 files is:\n\\[\n\\text{Size of 980 files} = 980 \\times \\frac{5}{3}\\, \\text{GB} = \\frac{4900}{3}\\, \\text{GB} \\approx 1633.33\\, \\text{GB}\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Total storage requirement\nYour current usage is already at **2,100 GB**. Adding the storage needed for the next 980 files:\n\\[\n\\text{Total storage needed} = 2,100\\, \\text{GB} + 1633.33\\, \\text{GB} \\approx 3733.33\\, \\text{GB} = 3.733\\, \\text{TB}\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Choose the minimum plan to cover the storage\nFrom the table:\n- **Standard plan**: 2 TB (not enough)\n- **Plus plan**: 10 TB (enough)\n- **Premium plan**: 50 TB (more than enough but not necessary)\n\nThe **Plus plan** provides 10 TB of storage, which is sufficient to cover your needs. Therefore, you need to upgrade to the Plus plan.\n\n### Step 6: Cost of upgrading to the Plus plan\nThe cost of the Plus plan is:\n\\[\n\\$19.99/\\text{month}\n\\]\n\n### Step 7: Calculate the average additional cost per file\nThe total number of files you will upload is:\n\\[\n60 + 980 = 1040\\, \\text{files}\n\\]\nOut of these, 60 files were already uploaded under the Standard plan, so the additional cost applies only to the 980 new files. The average additional cost per file is:\n\\[\n\\text{Average additional cost per file} = \\frac{\\$19.99}{980}\n\\]\n\nPerforming the division:\n\\[\n\\frac{19.99}{980} \\approx 0.0204\n\\]\n\nRounding to the nearest cent:\n\\[\n0.0204 \\approx 0.02\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer:\nFINAL ANSWER: 0.02", "start_time": 1754746804.834521, "end_time": 1754746804.8345213}, "status": "finished"}

For the purpose of this question, assume that the player uses any health-restoring items already held optimally, but that the player does not defeat any enemies and consequently does not find any additional health-restoring items.\n\nPlease report your answer as an integer number of times the player can sustain damage prior to being defeated.", "final_answer": "To determine how many times the player character can sustain damage before being defeated, we need to analyze the information provided in the image:\n\n1. **Health Display**: The heart symbol represents the player's current health.

The \"X3\" next to it indicates there are 3 bottles available.\n   - Each bottle typically restores a fixed amount of health. Since the player has 5 hearts left and there are 3 bottles, we need to consider if these bottles can restore enough health to prevent defeat.\n\n3. **Damage Calculation**:\n   - Each time the player is hit by an enemy, they lose one health point.\n   - The player starts with 5 health points and can potentially regain health using the bottles.\n\n4. **Optimal Use of Bottles**:\n   - If the player uses the bottles optimally, each bottle can restore 1 health point (a common mechanic in retro games).\n   - With 3 bottles, the player can regain up to 3 health points after taking damage.\n\n5. **Total Health Capacity**:\n   - Initially, the player has 5 health points.\n   - After using all 3 bottles, the player can have a maximum of \\( 5 + 3 = 8 \\) health points.\n\n6. **Maximum Damage Sustained**:\n   - The player can sustain damage equal to their total health capacity.\n   - Therefore, the player can sustain up to 8 hits before being defeated.\n\n### Final Answer:\nFINAL ANSWER: 8", "start_time": 1754746820.4572775, "end_time": 1754746820.4572778}, "status": "finished"}

We'll identify each note based on its position relative to the staff lines.\n\n- The **bass clef** indicates that the second line from the bottom represents F3 (middle C is C4).\n- The staff consists of five lines and four spaces between them.\n\n#### Identifying Each Note:\n1. The first note is on the third space from the bottom. In bass clef, this corresponds to **A**.\n2. The second note is on the fourth line from the bottom. This corresponds to **C**.\n3. The third note is on the second space from the bottom. This corresponds to **E**.\n4. The fourth note is on the fifth line (the top line). This corresponds to **G**.\n5. The fifth note is on the third line from the bottom. This corresponds to **B**.\n\nThus, the sequence of notes is: **A, C, E, G, B**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Word Spelled Out by the Notes\nThe notes spell out the word \"ACEGB.\" However, this does not form a standard English word directly. Instead, it suggests a numerical representation where each letter corresponds to its position in the alphabet:\n- A = 1\n- C = 3\n- E = 5\n- G = 7\n- B = 2\n\nAdding these values together gives us the sum:\n$$\n1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 2 = 18\n$$\n\nSo, the word \"ACEGB\" represents the number **18**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Count the Total Number of Lines and Notes\nThere are **five lines** in the staff. The total number of notes in the image is **5**.\n\nTotal lines and notes:\n$$\n5 \\text{ (lines) } + 5 \\text{ (notes) } = 10\n$$\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Count the Number of Notes on Lines\nFrom the identified notes:\n- The second note (C) is on the fourth line.\n- The fourth note (G) is on the fifth line.\n- The fifth note (B) is on the third line.\n\nThus, there are **3 notes on lines**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Calculate the Final Age\nWe are asked to find the age of someone who has experienced the word spelled out in the sheet music. According to the instructions, this involves calculating:\n$$\n\\text{Age} = (\\text{Total lines and notes}) - (\\text{Number of notes on lines})\n$$\n\nSubstituting the values:\n$$\n\\text{Age} = 10 - 3 = 7\n$$\n\nHowever, the word \"ACEGB\" itself represents the number **18**, which appears to be the intended \"age\" based on the context of the question.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer\nFINAL ANSWER: 18", "start_time": 1754747262.663078, "end_time": 1754747262.663078}, "status": "finished"}

I have 980 more files of the same size to upload. What is the average additional cost per file in dollar that goes over my current plan limit rounded to the nearest cent if I have to upgrade to the minimum possible plan to store them all? Answer with the following format: x.xx", "final_answer": "### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Understand the Current Situation**:\n   - You are using the \"Standard\" plan, which provides 2 TB of storage.\n   - You are already 100 GB over the limit, meaning you have used \\(2 \\text{ TB} + 100 \\text{ GB}\\).\n   - Convert everything to gigabytes (GB) for consistency:\n     \\[\n     2 \\text{ TB} = 2000 \\text{ GB}\n     \\]\n     So, you have used:\n     \\[\n     2000 \\text{ GB} + 100 \\text{ GB} = 2100 \\text{ GB}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Calculate Total Files Uploaded So Far**:\n   - You uploaded 60 equally sized files and used 2100 GB.\n   - Let the size of each file be \\(x\\) GB. Then:\n     \\[\n     60x = 2100 \\implies x = \\frac{2100}{60} = 35 \\text{ GB/file}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Determine Storage Needed for Remaining Files**:\n   - You have 980 more files to upload, each of size 35 GB.\n   - The total storage needed for these 980 files is:\n     \\[\n     980 \\times 35 = 34300 \\text{ GB}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Total Storage Required After Uploading All Files**:\n   - Including the 2100 GB already used, the total storage required is:\n     \\[\n     2100 + 34300 = 36400 \\text{ GB}\n     \\]\n\n5. **Choose the Minimum Plan That Can Accommodate This Storage**:\n   - **Standard Plan**: 2 TB = 2000 GB (too small).\n   - **Plus Plan**: 10 TB = 10000 GB (too small).\n   - **Premium Plan**: 50 TB = 50000 GB (sufficient).\n\n   Therefore, you need to upgrade to the Premium Plan.\n\n6. **Cost of Upgrading to the Premium Plan**:\n   - The Premium Plan costs \\$39.99/month.\n\n7. **Additional Cost Per File**:\n   - The total number of files being stored after uploading all 980 files is:\n     \\[\n     60 + 980 = 1040 \\text{ files}\n     \\]\n   - The additional cost per file is the cost of the Premium Plan divided by the number of files:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Additional cost per file} = \\frac{39.99}{1040}\n     \\]\n\n8. **Perform the Calculation**:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{39.99}{1040} \\approx 0.03845192307692308\n   \\]\n   Round this to the nearest cent:\n   \\[\n   0.03845192307692308 \\approx 0.04\n   \\]\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\[\n\\boxed{0.04}\n\\]", "start_time": 1754747294.2028995, "end_time": 1754747294.2028997}, "status": "finished"}
